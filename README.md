# MIPS Processor Implementation

### Project: Simplified MIPS Processor Architecture  
### Language: VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language)  
### Target Platform: FPGA (Xilinx Nexys A7)

This VHDL project implements a simplified MIPS-style processor based on classic RISC architecture principles. It enables the processor to:

  1. Fetch instructions from instruction memory.
  2. Decode instructions and read operands from the register file.
  3. Execute arithmetic and logic operations using an ALU.
  4. Access data memory for load and store instructions.
  5. Write results back to the register file.
  6. Control program flow using branch and jump instructions.

## Functionality

- **Instruction Fetch Phase**: 
  The program counter (PC) selects the next instruction from instruction memory. The PC is updated sequentially or modified by branch and jump logic.

- **Instruction Decode Phase**:
  The instruction fields are decoded, source registers are read, and immediate values are extended as needed. Control signals are generated by the control unit.

- **Execution Phase**:
  The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations, computes branch target addresses, and evaluates branch conditions.

- **Memory Access Phase**:
  For load and store instructions, the processor accesses data memory using the address computed by the ALU.
  
- **Write-Back Phase**:
  The final result, either from the ALU or memory, is written back to the destination register.

- **Control and Debug Output**:
  - LEDs display active control signals and processor state.
  - Seven-segment display shows selected internal values such as instructions, register contents, or ALU results.
